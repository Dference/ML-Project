# NFL Machine Learning Project

## Rise of the Machines

For this project, the group looked to utilize machine learning to create a model that could predict the outcome of NFL games, using recorded stats since the date of the last NFL expansion in 2002. 

The group wanted to explore several questions for the project shown below:

- How could machine learning be used to predict the outcome of the games?
- How would the group fit the model to accomplish our goal?
- Would the model accurately perform and are there any shortcomings of the model created?
  

The dataset was quite large, with the stats from the seasons spanning many years, creating a large training dataset for the model to learn from. There was some grooming done to the dataset, helping to have the model be properly fitted, with the group not wanting to overfit/underfit the model. One area where the group had to focus was the tuning for the model, with high loss shown, leading to the group working on feature engineering as well as hyperparameter tuning to bring down the loss for the model with the best results shown after using the mean squared error metric. To create visualizations for the project the group utilized Pandas and Matplotlib, using the dataset to create visualizations to review stats from past seasons, helping to see firsthand how the model reacted to the data given. Overall, the project was very successful, with the group creating a model in the end that gave accurate enough predicitons to feel comfortable that the outcomes reflected proper fitting.
